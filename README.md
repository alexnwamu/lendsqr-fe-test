# Frontend Assessment - Lendsqr Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a dashboard application developed as part of a frontend assessment for Lendsqr. It showcases a modern user interface built using Next.js with TypeScript for type safety, SCSS for preprocessing styles, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. The application is designed according to specifications provided in the Figma design file.

## Features

- **Responsive Dashboard**: A clean, user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **TypeScript Support**: Enhances code quality and maintainability through static typing.
- **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and responsiveness.
- **SCSS Preprocessing**: Allows for modular and organized styling with SCSS.
- **Mock API Integration**: Uses [mocky.io](http://mocky.io) for hosting a mock API, facilitating smooth development and testing.
- **Testing with Jest and React Testing Library**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and reliability.
